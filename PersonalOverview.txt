(Skills slash concepts I wish to learn in the future, a way to organize myself)


Sliding and wall jumping (physics I guess) and spoofing animations?
Horse movement with WASD (learning how to make cars just allows for horse movements too I suppose)
General rules when it comes to optimization 
Player inventory, hunger, global storage system wtv that means?
"experience with Octree grid for spatial queries" -- i'll look into this
slapping towers (horrible fucking idea lmao) he wants someone to script him a game where you slap towers and they hit back

Could learn how to do for fun: restaurant tycoon subsystems? cooking, serving etc etc

Could learn how to make NPC AI too

some terms that i dont know what they mean: Spherical Coordination
Object Tweening

custom generation (world, obby etc)


Experience in: Tower Defense Games (apparently lots of shitheads love tower defense), Simulator games (a broad category but they all follow quite the same
pattern), Tycoon Games (self-explanatory), Fighting games slash RPG games (combat systems, quest system etc etc).


Roblox FPS (learning how to create guns, working with first person system)
Vehicles (learning how to script vehicles from scratch)
AI behaviour (boss fights per say, or just normal NPC ai behaviour)
Custom Generation (would be fun to learn how a randomly generated obby is made I know someone made that already)

Roact, Rodux, cmdr, DataStore2 (submodules, dependabot)
